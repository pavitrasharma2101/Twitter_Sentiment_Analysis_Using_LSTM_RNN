# Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis_Using_LSTM_RNN

Developed a sentiment analysis model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to analyze Twitter data. The project involved collecting and preprocessing tweet data, implementing an LSTM RNN model using Python (TensorFlow, Keras), and performing sentiment classification into positive, negative, and neutral categories. Achieved high accuracy in sentiment prediction by leveraging advanced NLP techniques and deep learning. The model provided insights into public opinion trends and supported real-time sentiment monitoring for business and research applications.
